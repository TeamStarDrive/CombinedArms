  <Description>The food replicator provides healthy, replicated food for a colony. Replication amounts are rather low, but it can be enough for an early stage colony and might be sufficient for small mining colonies as well. It's biggest advantage is that it can be built even on un-habitable tiles. But costs are high if built out of scope of a colony ship.</Description>
