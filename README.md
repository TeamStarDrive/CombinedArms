# Combined Arms
### This is an edited version of the original Combomod. BlackBox features are supported where possible.

- Done some balancing to weapons and other modules
- Fixed some not working weapons with the newest BlackBox version.
- Edited a bit tech tree
- Disabled some custom ship hulls since they were clearly poor quality and odd looking
- Added new explosion animation [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IILg5Xqe6b4)
- Changed modules mass to make bigger ships way slower than the smaller ones.
- Edited starting racial traits for more fun.
- Edited racial trait costs for harder choices in selecting bit OP ones.
- Added quite a lot new ship designs with new high end modules to make mid-end game more challenging.

Weapons/modules and race balance might still be a issue but sadly its hard to test this alone.

Anyway try it out and report any issues you might find.
