If you have old Combined Arms mod dir- YOU MUST DELETE it before installing the new one. Note that onces you installed the mod, the new patcher wuill update CA as well, if needed.
* It is recommended to remove your saved ship designs if you saved designs using the old combo mod. Usually its located in c:\users\[username]\.appdata\roaming\stardrive\saveddesigns
* You need to update the latest blackbox build before loading Combined Arms. The auto patcher will prompt and install latest patch for you.
* Start the game and load the mod from the mod menu.

Some stuff changed in Combined Arms:
- Done some balancing to weapons and other modules
- Fixed some not working weapons with the newest BlackBox version.
- Edited a bit tech tree
- Disabled some custom ship hulls since they were clearly poor quality and odd looking
- Added new explosion animation [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IILg5Xqe6b4)
- Changed modules mass to make bigger ships way slower than the smaller ones.
- Edited starting racial traits for more fun.
- Edited racial trait costs for harder choices in selecting bit OP ones.
- Added quite a lot new ship designs with new high end modules to make mid-end game more challenging.

Weapons/modules and race balance might still be a issue but sadly its hard to test this alone.

Anyway try it out and report any issues you might find.
