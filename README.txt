# Combined Arms
### This is an edited version of the original Combomod. BlackBox features are supported where possible.

In order to install and play Combined arms you need a Vanilla copy of StarDrive 1. 
See installation guide video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhudgmoLATY&ab_channel=Goldymires

* Get a Vanilla copy from Steam. If you have the game already installed, a re-install its recommended, since we saw several early game crashes being solved by re-installation).
* Install latest build (https://bitbucket.org/codegremlins/stardrive-blackbox/downloads/), make sure to give the installer the exact path of the game if it is not installed on the default steam directory.
* Download the mod (https://bitbucket.org/codegremlins/combined-arms/downloads/) and extract it into the mods dir of StardDrive. If you have old Combined Arms mod dir- YOU MUST DELETE it before installing the new one.
* It is recommended to remove your saved ship designs if you saved designs using the old combo mod. Usually its located in c:\users\[username]\.appdata\roaming\stardrive\saveddesigns
* Start the game and load the mod from the mod menu.
* Drop us a note in Discord chat (https://discord.gg/dfvnfH4).

Some stuff changed in Combined Arms:
- Done some balancing to weapons and other modules
- Fixed some not working weapons with the newest BlackBox version.
- Edited a bit tech tree
- Disabled some custom ship hulls since they were clearly poor quality and odd looking
- Added new explosion animation [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IILg5Xqe6b4)
- Changed modules mass to make bigger ships way slower than the smaller ones.
- Edited starting racial traits for more fun.
- Edited racial trait costs for harder choices in selecting bit OP ones.
- Added quite a lot new ship designs with new high end modules to make mid-end game more challenging.

Weapons/modules and race balance might still be a issue but sadly its hard to test this alone.

Anyway try it out and report any issues you might find.
