      <TitleText>It's an alien nest!</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>As your troops approach the cave, they hear sounds coming from inside. Tossing in a flare to illuminate the depths, they spot movement. Unfortunately, a nest of antlions has made its home here! In an attempt at clearing the alien colony inside, they decided to drop explosives into the cave. The detonation shook the earth, causing a sinkhole to envelop the terrain even deeper into the planet. This causes the release of a multitude of toxic gasses. Soon after, the cave is filled with highly corrosive liquid. From initial scans, it seems to be a unique third state of hydrogen.</DescriptionText>

      <TitleText>Scam</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>While exploring the cave, your troops encountered a shady-looking character who claimed to be a cave explorer.

After the successful transaction, the troops went straight for the secret room to recover the tech. Sadly, it wasnt there. They were scammed by that fat bastard.</DescriptionText>
