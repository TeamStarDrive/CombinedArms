      <TitleText>The Heavy fall</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>As your troops land, they notice the space elevator appears to be very old, likely at risk of crumbling at any moment. Unfortunately, due to the disturbances from their troop shuttles, the elevator begins to slowly tilt and crumble. The enormous structure starts to break apart, raining down balls of fire to the ground! The planet's surface is damaged severely.</DescriptionText>

      <TitleText>Costly encounter!</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>As your troops land, they notice that the space elevator appears to be very old, likely beyond repair. The best solution was to carefully demolish it in a controlled way, to prevent a catastrophic collapse. As your troops begin placing the demolition charges, a horde of antlions crawl out of the structure! A fierce battle rages on, causing more damage to the structure in the process as it begins to collapse.</DescriptionText>
