      <TitleText>Minor shock</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>From far away, your troops observe as the pillar attracts strikes of lightning. When the approach closer, they detect a powerful energy signature coming directly from it. The pillar appears to be capable of attracting these strikes, and harnessing the resulting energy inside of itself to be stored. As your troops attempt to decipher the engravings on the pillar, they must have accidentally triggered a release mechanism. The energy stored inside the pillar is sent deep into the planet's core, destroying the pillar, but jump-starting the core into producing rare elements.</DescriptionText>
