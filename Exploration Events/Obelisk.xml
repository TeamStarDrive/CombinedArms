      <TitleText>Wave</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>As your troops get closer to the obelisk, they notice that the terrain surrounding it's completely barren. While approaching slowly, they suddenly hear a high pitched tone coming directly from the obelisk, its volume becoming increasingly unbearable! Your troops decide retreat into the space shuttle and rise the shields. At some point, the obelisk disintegrates and sends forth a massively deadly wave of radiation, killing almost all forms of life on the planet. What have we done? Planet scans changed :-1.5 Fertility (temporally).</DescriptionText>
